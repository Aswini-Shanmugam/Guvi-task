The Difference Between Documents and Window Objects:

In JavaScript, there are two important objects that you'll work with frequently: the document object and the window object. While they are both important parts of the browser's DOM (Document Object Model), they have some key differences.

The Window Object:

The window object represents the entire web browser window or tab. It provides access to all the browser's APIs and functionality, such as:
• Accessing the browser's history and navigation
• Interacting with the browser's console
• Handling events like clicks, scrolls, and resizes
• Performing timers with setTimeout() and setInterval()
• Accessing information about the browser and operating system
The window object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy and is considered the "global" object in client-side JavaScript.

The Document Object:

The document object, on the other hand, represents the current web page loaded in the browser window. It provides access to the content and structure of the page, such as:
• Querying and manipulating HTML elements
• Accessing the page's URL and other metadata
• Adding event listeners to elements
• Creating, modifying, and deleting nodes in the DOM
The document object is a property of the window object, so you can access it as window.document. However, the document object is more commonly used directly, without referencing the window.

Key Differences

1.Scope: The window object represents the entire browser window, while the document object represents the current web page.
2. Hierarchy: The window object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy, while the document object is a property of the window object.
3. Functionality: The window object provides access to browser-level functionality, while the document object provides access to page-level content and structure.
In summary, the window object and the document object are both essential in client-side JavaScript development, but they serve different purposes. The window object gives you control over the browser, while the document object gives you control over the content of the current web page.
