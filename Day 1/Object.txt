Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

An object is a collection of key value pairs or collection of properties and it is a data type. where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects are used to represent real-world entities, data structures, and more complex data types.Anything and everything in JS is Object storing structured data.

1.	Dot operator and array bracket is used

Eg:
{
[key]: value
}

“key: value” pairs = These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties.

{
name: “Manisha”,
Age: 26
}

data.name  = is used to add a new key value and we can also update a value
data.age
data[‘name’]
data[‘age’]
delete data.age = delete a key and its corresponding value

Objects in JS is most important data-type.These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
